Today in HydraPWK blog post, update History pages and recover archived pages, this post will talking about update in [HydraPWK History Pages](/doc/introduction/hydra-history)

this post is not too `important` because we just talking about [Pages History](/doc/introduction/hydra-history), (besides you wanna seen how stupid i'm before).

# how can we recover the pages?
let's say we(me) just relaxing on my bed scrolling my gmail and waiting [DistroWatch](https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20250721#waiting) (if you doesn't know we have submitted this project into `DistroWatch Team` and yeah surprisingly we just need two hours after we make submission to be `waiting list`, but forget it we will focus to this post).

then yeah i just scrolling my phone, checking git like usual, and yeah we check our commit in `hydrapwk.github.io` and we just realized `GitHub` not remove assets like image and whatever is that's so easly we can recover our old pages.

why this is surprising me? that's because GitHub (i dont know gitlab will doing seems something like GitHub or not) i think GitHub just will give me commit history but im wrong, and yeah github have `Full repository` of my commit (our commit).
