Today, in HydraPWK post in this time we will giving good and little bad news, and also polkitd as dependencies in our metapackages.

# HydraPWK on distrowatch

Even though it hasn't been officially announced by distrowatch, looking at the [HydraPWK page on distrowatch](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=hydrapwk), we decided to make our own post about it.

Almost three years developing [HydraPWK](https://hydrapwk.github.io/doc/introduction/about-hydra) (Formerly known as [BlackTrack](https://hydrapwk.github.io/doc/introduction/hydra-history)) and this time has come and we're (I'm) very excited about it, looking and developing how this project growing, until like this, maybe you just thinking this project is bad, this project is too ambitious, you're not wrong about that's maybe you right.

And the first achievement was getting into distrowatch, I mean, less than two months since we submitted this project and that was one of our best achievements, In less than two months, this small project made it onto the distrowatch page among other big projects!.

And we're very thank you about it!, and with our loyal community especially Mr.pro and Fox47, I'm very thank you with you guys! Thanks once again, You've been with me all the way from the first time this project was created(BlackTrack) until now!(HydraPWK).

# We got banned from reddit

If you looking our previous announcement ([HydraPWK Migrate](https://hydrapwk.github.io/blog/hydrawpk-migrate)) we're giving announcement, if we're making new sub community on [reddit r/hydrapwk](https://reddit.com/r/hydrapwk) and mastodon ([infosec.exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@hydrapwk)) but yeah sadly we got banned from reddit.

We have submitted an appeal to Reddit, but until now there has been no response. We hope that the Reddit platform (mods) will investigate it immediately.

# polkitd

We are currently weighing the pros and cons of adding polkitd to our IMAGE/ISO (as a dependency on our desktop metapackages).

We calculate the pros and cons on HydraPWK performance (polkitd will enter as autostart on the desktop) If the benefits are greater, perhaps we will consider making it part of the metapackage (dependencies hydrapwk-default-desktop).

# Thanks!

And to conclude this post, we'd like to thank Debian and its community and developers! Without them, this project wouldn't exist!.

Once again, thanks everyone! Don't forget you're free to open issues and giving critique off course.
