Today on HydrPWK blog post, we wanna annoucing about plan to drop support `WAS(Web applications security)` packages for Next release HydraPWK, previously we have release [BlackTrack Transition to HydraPWK](https://hydrapwk.github.io/blog/hydrapwk-2025.1.6.5-release), thats blog containt new release and anouncment about this project.


and now we're planning to drop support for `WAS` packages.
Why? Thats because we wanna do efficiency to this project if you have read the post release [before](https://hydrapwk.github.io/blog/hydrapwk-2025.1.6.5-release) you will know why.

if you doesn't know let me explain

# new goal and purpose

Almost three years i'm develop this project (This project has been running for almost three years), and we focussed on `WAS(web applications security)`, but now (since we announcment and release BlackTrack evolution into HydraPWk), we will focus and push this project into `Industry`.

No we're not will leave pentesting section, because in this (goal and purpose), We will focus in Pentesting and forensic for industry area such Automotive, drone/uav, embedded system, avionik/airplane, marrine and etc.

Thats why we wanna drop support For WAS packages, but this is just plan for now, The final outcome regarding the fate of the package (WAS) is in your hands. We've created a poll in the official [HydraPWK community](https://t.me/blacktracksecurity). You're free to vote! Share your opinion!
