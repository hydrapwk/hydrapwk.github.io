# Online repo

Finally!, we are trying to create an official repository for BlackTrack (Even though it is still in the experimental stage) and we don't know how long the repository will be running (depending on funding from my parents &#128077; ), but we are very, very happy about this!.

```bash
deb http://repo.rstrike.my.id/ vanguard main
```
Main page about this repo [rstrike.my.id](https://rstrike.my.id)


# New tools

In this release 2.0, we added approximately five new tools to the official BlackTrack repository (tools from the official Debian repository are not counted here).

- [betaflight configurator]() - Cross platform configuration tool for the Betaflight firmware.
- [satdump]() - SatDump is a general purpose satellite data processing software.
- [wall-of-flipper]() - A simple and easy way to find Flipper Zero Devices and Bluetooth Low Energy Based Attacks.

If you request tools to be added to the BlackTrack repository, please contact the BlackTrack developer, or send the request format in the Telegram community with the format.

# Desktop changes

For this release, we updated and fixed something that was missing, such as the WIFI icon in the previous version (1.0) where the WiFi icon was missing, and we also changed several icons.
and we also updated the login screen and GRUB themes, which can be seen below.

# Calamares installer

Good news!, we have added calamares installation in this release!, although I'm sure no one uses this distro besides me

# Page changes

In this release, we also changed the design of our official page to make it more attractive? I think, also to adapt to the BlackTrack concept
