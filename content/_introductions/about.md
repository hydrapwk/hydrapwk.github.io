# About HydraPWK

> This pages still in development

HydraPWK ([Precviously named by BlackTrack]()) is an OpenSource Linux distribution based on [Debian Project distro]() .

This distribution contains several Penetration Testing tools, Includes Information gathering, scanning, Stress Testing, Exploitation, Cracking, Reversing, Forensics, Drone.

### What is HydraPWK?
HydraPWK is Open-source Linux Distribution based on `Debian GNU/Linux <debian.org>`, aimed for research and pentesting on Industry area.

### Open-source
This project is Open-source, based on `Debian GNU/Linux <debian.org>` under DFSG license.

Don't worry about security, you can always check our sources

### How this is work?
This project is `different` from another project, We emphasize this project for real-time pentesting, encouraging it to help red-team experts to perform physical pentesting.
As default we're using RT kernel `full patched` make sure Everything is running on time.

<i>We build things for the industry.</i>
### HydraPWK Features
> - [RT kernel]() - As default hydrapwk using RT(real-time) kernel `<VERSION_KERNEL>-xhydrapwk-rt1-antihacker-<ARCH>`, thats bacause we are focusing hydrapwk for the real-time hardware hacking(physical hardware pentesting), thats why we need `low latency` for communicate with the target.
> - [Plug and Play]() - hydrapwk it's self having linux kernel name `xhydrapwk-rt1-antihacker` or `<VERSION_KERNEL>-xhydrapwk-rt1-antihacker-<ARCH>` not just RT as default we have also `built-in` kernel module, so with this you don't need to load module manually and thats will automatically loaded on boot.
> - [Open-source]() - this software is Open-source all packages (a lot of packages/tools) under DFSG, GPLv2+, GPLv3, GPLv2, Apache license and it's Open-source (only on component main/free)
> - [Device support]() - Curently we are still developing or adapt hydrapwk into `embedded device` like TvBox and Mobile.
> - [Drop unit]() - Drop every node cache every shutdown and boot
