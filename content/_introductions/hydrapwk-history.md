> HydraPWK (Previously BlackTrack), is an self development project

### 2023 The Beginning.

In 2023 Precisely on January 25, 2023 The founder hydrapwk(BlackTrack at that's time) @me-joe say in he telegram channel.

> "do you guys agree, if I make my own Linux distro?", "Yes!"

Two people say "Yes" (not much but enough for we're starting this project until now).



Long short story on March 20, 2023 We successfully built "BlackTrack" for the first time! (But, that's not enough for public release, no installation support so we decided to private usage).


On March 23, 2023 (Just a few days after we announced our build), we're trying to use "calamares installer" but that's not enough "calamares" not working.


Long short story On Apr 03 2023, we're released BlackTrack for first time into public (v2.0 with codename sate) we're using calamares from Debian on that's version, and user still need manually to configuring that's version.

On Apr 10/11 2023, we're paused development, because that's ramadhan I'm on vacation, but still giving announcements to "BlackTrack" Members.
Long short stories On 19 Apr, 2023 @MartinVlba joining the game he helping me a lot for configuring "BlackTrack".

v2.0b not released? Why? Since there are only a few changes, and we are not ready to release it yet, we are skipping this version.

### May 2023 The Game changer.
Let's say May 2023 is game changer! Why? In that's month (Precisely on May 02, 2023 we're released "BlackTrack v3.0a reog" in this version we have ready fixing installer, Theme application, and other configurations, and we've added some tools too!.
And yeah! For the first time, someone tried our project! Thank you pozytron for trying "BlackTrack"!.

On 19 may 2023, @MartinVlba helping me to setup repos! (Although at that time we were still relying on the Debian repo, and didn't have our own repo).

### Branding problem.
I don't know why, but I don't really like the "BlackTrack" branding but we still use it! And i Love it!.

### Nov 2023.
On Nov 2023 we're released "v4.0 Surabaya" this version, It's really pretty for us, with over 50 tools provided by default!. Let's say this version is one of our best versions yet!, also in this version we're Decided to copy the theme from "pwnbox hackthebox".

### BlackTrack evolution into Hydra.
After we're release BlackTrack from version v2.0 2023 until v3.0 batik 2025, as last release of BlackTrack!.
