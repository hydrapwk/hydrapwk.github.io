After a long time, BlackTrack was no longer developed, and now BlackTrack is here (Next Gen) by presenting a new concept!.
And introduce this is BT 1.o!.

# Desktop change


in BT v1.o, we completely changed the theme concept and mechanism from the previous BlackTrack release.
for this release (BT 1.o) there are several changes to the icons and themes with concepts such as ctOS (central operating system) in watchdogs 2!.

*	For the GTK theme we modified the theme from [tofutech](https://github.com/tofutech), to adapt to the MATE desktop and made some changes.
*	For the GTK icon theme from [PaulLEsur](https://github.com/PaulLesur/plasma-pixel-icon-theme), we modified some missing icons and replaced some icons, and added some icons from [ElbulAzul](https://github.com/B00merang-Artwork/Windows-10) for the folder icon. and several other icons such as action, mount icon, we took them from [drasite](https://drasite.com/flat-remix).
*	For making wallpapers we take several images from several sources

# New app

in this version (BT 1.o) we added [armitage](#) to the release list this time.

# new pages design

Almost every new BlackTrack release we change the design on the BlackTrack page, for this version you can see it on [Home page](https://blacktracksec.github.io) and [download page](https://blacktracksec.github.io /down_)

# Mechanism Changes

For this time and (next time), we have completely changed the BlackTrack mechanism which was previously bare metal, now in BT 1.o we use a live USB mechanism, with several goals including portability, and most importantly anti-f#rensic. (we still need in-depth research on this)
